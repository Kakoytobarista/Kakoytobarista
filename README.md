For the past few years, I have been involved in the development of automated tests as a Software engineer in test. I am well versed in UI automation, API, which helps me to show good results in all directions. In view of experience, I often help colleagues in thinking through the architecture of autotests or their implementation. I independently lead projects with autotests from creating a repository and working out the architecture to containerization and integration into CI / CD. I managed to work in the field of information security and mobility aggregation, I will be glad to work on something new and just as interesting!
I spend a lot of time developing as a freelancer and as a hobby.
